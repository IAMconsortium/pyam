Overview and scope
------------------

The ``pyam`` package provides a range of diagnostic tools and functions  
for analyzing and working with IAMC-format timeseries data. 

Features:
- Summary of models, scenarios, variables, and regions included in a snapshot.
- Display of timeseries data as pandas.DataFrame with IAMC-specific filtering 
  options.
- Simple visualization and plotting functions.
- Diagnostic checks for non-reported variables or timeseries data to identify 
  outliers and potential reporting issues.
- Categorization of scenarios according to timeseries data or meta-identifiers 
  for further analysis.

The package can be used with timeseries data that follows the data template 
convention of the [Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/iamc/) (IAMC).
An illustrative example is shown below;
see [data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/database](http://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/database/) 
for more information.
