Overview and scope
------------------

The open-source Python package ``pyam`` provides a suite of tools and functions
for analyzing and visualizing input data (i.e., assumptions/parametrization) 
and results (model output) of integrated-assessment scenarios.

Key features:

 - Simple analysis of timeseries data in the IAMC format
   (more about it [here](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html))
   with an interface similar in feel and style to the widely
   used [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html)
 - Advanced visualization and plotting functions
   (see the [gallery](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html))
 - Diagnostic checks for scripted validation of scenario data and results

Data model
----------

An illustrative example of the timeseries format developed by the
[Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/iamc/) (IAMC)
is shown below.
The row is taken from the [IAMC 1.5Â°C scenario explorer](https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/iamc-1.5c-explorer),
showing a scenario from the [CD-LINKS](https://www.cd-links.org) project.
[Read the docs](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html)
for more information on the IAMC format and the ``pyam`` data model.

Tutorials
---------

An introduction to the basic functions is shown
in [the "first-steps" notebook](doc/source/tutorials/pyam_first_steps.ipynb).

All tutorials are available in rendered format (i.e., with output) as part of
the [online documentation](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials.html).
The source code of the tutorials notebooks is available
in the folder [doc/source/tutorials](doc/source/tutorials) of this repository.

Install
-------

For basic instructions,
[read the docs](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

To install from source after cloning this repository, simply run

```
pip install -e .
```

### Development

To setup a development environment, the simplest route is to make yourself 
a conda environment and then follow the `Makefile`. 

```sh
# pyam can be replaced with any other name
# you don't have to specify your python version if you don't want
conda create --name pyam pip python=X.Y.Z
conda activate pyam  # may be  simply `source activate pyam` or just `activate pyam`
# use the make file to create your development environment
# (you only require the -B flag the first time, thereafter you can
# just run `make virtual-environment` and it will only update if
# environment definition files have been updaed)
make -B virtual-environment
```

Instead of conda you could also use a pip virtualenv:
```sh
mkdir venv
virtualenv venv -p python3
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[test,optional-io-formats]
```

To check everything has installed correctly, run

```
pytest tests
```

All the tests should pass.
