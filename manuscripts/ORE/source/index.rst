Abstract
========

The open-source Python package **pyam** provides a suite of features and methods
for the analysis, validation and visualization of reference data and scenario results
generated by integrated assessment models, macro-energy tools and other frameworks
in the domain of energy transition, climate change mitigation and sustainable development.
It bridges the gap between scenario processing and visualisation solutions
that are "hard-wired" to specific modelling frameworks
and generic data analysis or plotting packages.

The package aims to facilitate reproducibility and reliability
of scenario processing, validation and analysis by providing well-tested
and documented methods for working with timeseries data
in the context of climate policy and energy systems.
It supports various data formats, including sub-annual resolution
using continuous time representation and "representative timeslices".

The **pyam** package can be useful for modelers generating scenario results using their
own tools as well as researchers and analysts working with existing scenario ensembles
such as those supporting the IPCC reports or produced in research projects.
It is structured in a way that it can be applied irrespective of a user's domain
expertise or level of Python knowledge, supporting experts as well as novice users.

The code base is implemented following best practices of collaborative
scientific-software development.
This manuscript describes the design principles of the package
and the types of data that can be handled.
The usefulness of **pyam** is illustrated by highlighting several recent applications.
