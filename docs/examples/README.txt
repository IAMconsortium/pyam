Plotting Gallery
================

All examples in this gallery currently use the *IAMC template* for yearly data,
but |pyam| also supports timeseries data with a sub-annual resolution.
Please read the `Data Model <../data.html>`_ section for more information.

For more information about the plotting module, refer to the
`plotting API documentation <../api/plotting.html>`_.
