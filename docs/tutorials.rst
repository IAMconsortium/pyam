Tutorials
=========

Jupyter notebooks
-----------------

All tutorials currently use the *IAMC template* for yearly data,
but |pyam| also supports timeseries data with a sub-annual resolution.
Please read the `Data Model <data.html>`_ section for more information.

The source code is available in the folder
`docs/tutorials`_ of the |pyam| GitHub repository.
