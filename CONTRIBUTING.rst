The pyam package has been developed with the explicit aim to facilitate
open and collaborative analysis of integrated assessment and climate models.
We appreciate contributions to the code base and development of new features.

Please use the GitHub *Issues* feature to raise questions concerning potential
bugs or to propose new features, but search and read resolved/closed topics on
similar subjects before raising a new issue.

For contributions to the code base, please use GitHub *Pull Requests*,
including a detailed description of the new feature and unit tests
to illustrate the intended functionality.
Code submitted via pull requests must adhere to the `pep8`_ style formats
and the documentation should follow  the `numpydoc docstring guide`_.

We do not require users to sign a *Contributor License Agreement*, because we
believe that when posting ideas or submitting code to an open-source project,
it should be obvious and self-evident that any such contributions
are made in the spirit of open collaborative development.
